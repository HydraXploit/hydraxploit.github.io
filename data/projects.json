            "A central place to share my cybersecurity journey, document experiences, and highlight personal projects was something I always wanted. So, I built my own website. A platform where I can write about the competitions I\u2019ve participated in, the events I\u2019ve attended, and the projects I\u2019m working on.",
            "The design is centered around a dark, neon-infused theme\u2014fitting for a cybersecurity-focused space and perfectly complementing my logo. Every element was selected to reflect the aesthetics of ethical hacking and digital security.",
            "For the technical side, I kept it simple yet functional. The site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript \u2014 no unnecessary frameworks, just a lightweight, efficient setup. The UI features smooth dynamic overlays to display blog posts and projects without clutter.",
            "Having my own platform gives me the flexibility to shape it however I want and evolve it over time. Whether it's writing about cybersecurity, sharing insights, or presenting future projects, this website serves as the foundation for it all."
