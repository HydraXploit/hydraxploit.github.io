            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Belgian student in my final year at Howest University of Applied Sciences, studying Applied
                Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity Professional.</p>
            <p>This website serves as my digital portfolio and blog. It includes reflections on events and activities
                I've participated in, cybersecurity challenges I've faced, and insights into my interests and skills
                within the field of IT and cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>My goal is to provide a clear, professional representation of who I am as an IT individual and where my
                focus lies within cybersecurity.</p>
